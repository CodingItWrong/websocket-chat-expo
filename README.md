# websocket-echo-expo

A simple WebSocket client using Expo and React Native, for Android, iOS, and Web.

Because some abstractions over WebSocket only work in the browser, compatibility with this tool demonstrates that a given WebSocket backend is standards-compliant and works in React Native too.

## Requirements

- [pnpm](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install)
- [Expo CLI](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started)
- A [websocket-echo backend](https://github.com/CodingItWrong?tab=repositories&q=websocket-echo&type=&language=&sort=)

## Installation

```bash
$ pnpm install
```

## Running

```bash
$ pnpm start
```

Then choose any of:

- Run on Android device/emulator
- Run on iOS simulator
- Run in web browser (React Native for Web)
